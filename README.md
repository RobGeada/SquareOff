# SquareOff

SquareOff is a simple text-based game that I wrote to teach myself Java. Manage your resources to survive as long as you can while you fight monsters and discover new towns! I've included all the class files in /source so you can build it yourself or look at what I did, or just use the .jar file in /package to run a pre-built version of the game.

###Usage
Simply click the launcher to run the game on Mac; use the .jar file to run it on other systems.

###Tips + Tricks
* Talk to every stranger you meet- they might have valuable information
* Visit the healer before you venture off into the unknown
* Clever players will discover how to farm easy monsters to prepare themselves for tougher foes
